"### What would you like to Propose?\n\nI found out that the Word Suggest System problem is not implemented. I'd like to contribute.\r\n\r\n**Word Suggest Problem Statement:**\r\n\r\nGiven an array of strings _products_ and a string _searchWord_\r\n\r\nDesign a system that suggests _productNames_ from _products_ after each character of _searchWord _ is typed. \r\n> Suggested products should have a common prefix with _searchWord_.\r\n> Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of _searchWord_ is typed.\r\n\n\n### Issue details\n\n**Example:**\r\n_products = {\"man\", \"mango\", \"manage\", \"map\", \"you\", \"match\", \"manuscript\", \"monk\"}_\r\n_searchword = \"man\"_\r\n\r\nWhen _m_ is typed\r\n> man, mango, manage, map, match, manuscript, and monk should be suggested\r\n\r\nWhen _a_ is typed\r\n> man, mango, manage, map, match, and manuscript should be suggested\r\n\r\nWhen _n_ is typed\r\n> man, mango, manage, and manuscript should be suggested\r\n\r\nFinally, the 2D list of strings is returned\r\n> {\r\n  {man, mango, manage, map, match, manuscript, monk },\r\n  {man, mango, manage, map, match, manuscript },\r\n  {man, mango, manage, manuscript }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by making use of Trie data structure.\r\n\r\nThank you.

Considering that if the input is large enough that the output will not fit inside a `long`  variable, rather than giving the wrong output, it should specify that the input is too large for this algorithm to be performed.\r\n\r\nAlso need some more test cases.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3757/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1":

input the binary number of 'String' data type, where there's no range limit.\r\nIt works with decimal numbers as well.\r\nIt works with both positive and negative values.\r\n\r\nWhereas the existing algorithm takes input only a positive binary whole number of 'int' data type, which limits the range of the binary digits.\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any reference to previous pull-request

Hence I would love to add the Java Code for the same here which will be helpful for the students to refer to and learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttaching the screenshot of the Railfence cipher input and output\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80584888/195462439-02500da6-1276-4c04-9cff-3fc501930c4b.png)\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3522/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3522/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "completed"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3521", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3521/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3521/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/issues/3521/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/3521", "id": 1406891286, "node_id": "PR_kwDOA8iXnM5AsEq3", "number": 3521, "title": "Upper.java", "user": {"login": "JunJul", "id": 108427029, "node_id": "U_kgDOBnZ3FQ", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108427029?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul", "html_url": "https://github.com/JunJul", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/JunJul/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "closed", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2022-10-12T22:50:05Z", "updated_at": "2022-10-16T07:09:53Z", "closed_at": "2022-10-16T07:09:53Z", "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/TheAlgorithms/Java/pulls/3521", "html_url": "https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/3521", "diff_url": "https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/3521.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/3521.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "### **Describe your change:**\r\n\r\n- [x ] Add an algorithm?\r\n- [ ] Fix a bug or typo in an existing algorithm?\r\n- [ ] Documentation change?\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n<We also can check if a character is lowercase by simple an ASCII value because lowercases are in the range of 97 to 123.

Salesman Problem** (also called the **Traveling Salesperson Problem** or **TSP**) asks the following question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?\" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in [theoretical computer science and operations research.\r\n\r\n![Euler12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71169457/194297860-f992579a-2ed4-41a5-93df-89aa1b8a8f65.png)\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the graph shown in the figure on the right side. A TSP tour in the graph is 1-2-4-3-1. The cost of the tour is 10+25+30+15 which is 80. The problem is a famous NP-hard problem. There is no polynomial-time know solution for this problem. The following are different solutions for the traveling salesman problem. \r\n\r\nNaive Solution: \r\n\r\n1) Consider city 1 as the starting and ending point.\r\n\r\n2) Generate all (n-1)! Permutations of cities. \r\n\r\n3) Calculate the cost of every permutation and keep track of the minimum cost permutation. \r\n\r\n4) Return the permutation with minimum cost. \r\n\r\nTime Complexity:

The goal is to partition S into two subsets with an equal sum in the partition problem. In the 3\u2013partition problem, the goal is to partition S into 3 subsets with an equal sum.\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\nS = { 7, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 8 }\r\n\r\nWe can partition S into three partitions, each

After removing some node all links for previous and next node should be reassigned. But current algorithm did not mentioned that next node could be null. For example (on this structure tests had failed in linked build):\r\n```\r\n[ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- --- --- --- --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] --- --- [ ] --- [ ] --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] [ ] --- [ ] --- [ ] --- --- [ ] --- --- \r\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] \r\n H   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10\r\n```\r\nWhen we try to delete node with index 0, it would have null next nodes on layers 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nI had fixed an issue and add test case with removing last node. So removing elements with pointers to null is tested separately now.\r\n\r\n### **Checklist:**\r\n\r\n<!-- Remove items that do not apply.
